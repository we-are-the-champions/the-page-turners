#!/bin/sh
# This post-merge hook in git automatically updates the repository with the latest version of the shared shell app after a successful merge. 
# It does this by running the following commands:
bit import && bit checkout head && bit link && bit compile

# The shared shell app is maintained by both the-page-turners and the header-herders teams. 
# The latest updates are retrieved from the components scope, which is considered the only source of truth for this component.

# the post-merge hook runs automatically, ensuring that the repository stays up-to-date with the latest version of the shared shell app without any manual intervention.×“
